<h1><u>White Stuff</u></h1>
    <ul>Empty a tub of Jet-Puffed Marshmallow Creme into a bowl.</ul>
    <ul>Add sour cream to taste, refrigerate. Sounds easy, is easy, it's addictive too.</ul>
    <ul>We've had Red Stuff and White Stuff on the major holidays my whole life.</ul>
    <ul>Serve it cold on the Red Stuff. Goes good on pumpkin pie too.</ul>
