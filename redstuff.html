    <body><h1>Red Stuff</h1>
    <h2><u>Ingredients</u></h2>
    <ul> 2 bags of frozen cranberries</ul>
    <ul> 2 packs of cherry or strawberry Jello</ul>
    <ul> 2.5 cups of boiling water</ul>
    <ul> 1/2 bag of small marshmallows</ul>
    <ul> 1/2 cup white sugar</ul>
    <ul> 1/2 can crushed pineapple</ul>
    <ul> 3/4 cup of walnuts</ul>
    <ul> 2 stalks of celery</ul>

    <h2><u>Notes</u></h2>
    
    <ul> The cranberries need to be frozen when processed and used.</ul>
    <ul> The pinapple must be canned. Fresh pineapple will ruin the Jello.</ul>
    <ul> Don't leave out the celery. Don't pour in extra pineapple juice.</ul>
    
    <h2><u>How to Make It</u></h2>
    <ul>Use glassware that can withstand boiling water.</ul>
    <ul>Use a food processor for the cranberries , celery, and nuts.</ul>
    <ul>Pick out any too big chunks of cranberry.</ul>
    <ul>Combine the boiling water and the Jello mixes in your glassware.</ul>
    <ul>Stir in all the ingredients except the marshmallows.</ul>
    <ul>Add the marshmallows on the top after combining the other ingredients.</ul>
    <ul>Sometimes marshmallows get mixed in too.</ul>
    <ul>Refrigerate uncovered for a couple of hours.</ul>
    <ul>Ok to cover after it fully sets ( 2-3 hours).</ul>
    <ul>Serve cold. Look below for how to make the sauce.</ul>

    <h1><u>White Stuff</u></h1>
    <ul>Empty a tub of Jet-Puffed Marshmallow Creme into a bowl.</ul>
    <ul>Add sour cream to taste, refrigerate. Sounds easy, is easy, it's addictive too.</ul>
    <ul>We've had Red Stuff and White Stuff on the major holidays my whole life.</ul>
    <ul>Serve it cold on the Red Stuff. Goes good on pumpkin pie too.</ul>
